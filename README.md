# odin-landing-page
## Introduction (Written before starting project)
 This is the second project in The Odin Project course, falling under the "Foundations" section of the course. This project involves creating a website landing page, using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. The page itself will consist of a total of five sections - four body sections, as well as a footer.

 For this project, two design images were presented. The first is a general mockup of the desired design, and the second lists the colors and fonts used in the design.

 This project will serve as an example of basic implementation of HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. It also serves as an example of taking a design mockup given without specifications and implementing it in a proper way to achieve the desired effect.
